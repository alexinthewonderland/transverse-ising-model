# transverse-ising-model
This is about my project on the Transverse Ising Model applied with an oscillating dynamic field. Here, the objective is to find the self-consistent equation of the magnetization in the z-axis direction using the Mean Field Theory, Floquet formalism, and also QuTiP as the fundamental library for the simulation in Python.
